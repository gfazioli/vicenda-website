    value: 'what',
    question: 'What is FinderGit?',
    answer:
      'FinderGit is a native macOS application that works as a Git-aware file browser. Think of it as Finder’s list view, but with Git status, branch info, inline diffs, and commit/push/pull actions built in.',
  },
  {

    question: 'Is FinderGit free?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, FinderGit is currently free. If you find it useful, consider{' '}

      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    value: 'appstore',
    question: 'Is FinderGit on the App Store? How do updates work?',
    answer:
      'FinderGit is distributed directly from findergit.app as a signed and notarized DMG — it’s not on the App Store. Updates are automatic: the app checks for new releases and installs them in place, so you’re always one click away from the latest version.',
  },
  {
    value: 'macos',
    question: 'What macOS version do I need?',
    answer:
      'macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later. FinderGit is built with SwiftUI and uses APIs available from macOS 15+.',
  },
  {
    value: 'languages',
    question: 'Which languages does FinderGit speak?',
    answer:
      'English, Italian, French, German, and Spanish. FinderGit follows your Mac’s system language automatically — there is no in-app switcher. To use a different language, reorder your preferred languages in System Settings → General → Language & Region.',
  },
  {
    value: 'replace',
    question: 'Does FinderGit replace my Git client?',
    answer:
      'Not entirely — but it covers more ground every release. Day-to-day work happens without leaving the app: status across many repos at once, stage/unstage and discard, commit (with AI-generated messages), push/pull/fetch, branch switching, and keeping forks in sync with their upstream. For advanced surgery (interactive rebase, cherry-pick, complex merges) you’ll still want a full Git client or the terminal.',
  },
  {
    value: 'github-account',
    question: 'Do I need to connect a GitHub account?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Only for the GitHub-powered extras — the{' '}

        dashboard, the issue / pull-request / star counts in the file browser, and new-star alerts.
        FinderGit reuses the GitHub CLI if it&apos;s already set up, or a personal access token you
        paste into Settings — kept in your Keychain, never written to disk. Plain browsing, Git
        status, diffs and commit / push / pull all work with no GitHub connection at all. See{' '}

        for setup.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    value: 'star-alerts',
    question: 'Can FinderGit tell me when one of my repos gets a star?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. The{' '}
        <Anchor href="/docs/account#new-star-notifications" size="sm">
          Account

        view shows a badge the moment a repository earns a star — naming which repo, not just
        bumping a number — and you can optionally turn on desktop notifications in Settings → Git.
        It checks periodically in the background while the app is running.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    value: 'detect',
    question: 'How does FinderGit detect repositories?',
    answer:
      'When you add a root folder, FinderGit recursively scans for directories containing .git/. The scan depth is configurable in Settings (default: 5 levels). Heavy directories like node_modules and DerivedData are automatically skipped.',
  },
  {
    value: 'modify',
    question: 'Does FinderGit modify my repositories?',
    answer:
      'Only when you explicitly perform an action (commit, push, pull, stage, etc.). FinderGit reads your repository state via git status and git diff — it never modifies anything without your command.',
  },
  {
    value: 'trust',
    question: 'Is it safe to open repositories I don’t fully trust?',
    answer: (
      <>
        That&apos;s what{' '}
        <Anchor href="/docs/repo-trust" size="sm">
          Repo Trust
        </Anchor>{' '}
        is for. FinderGit scans each repository&apos;s auto-run surface — hooks and configuration
        that could execute code when you open, build, or install — without ever running any of it.
        Repos with findings are flagged in the list, and you get an alert when that surface changes
        after a pull.

    ),
  },
  {
    value: 'verify',
    question: 'How do I verify a download — and what if a virus scanner flags it?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Every release is signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple, and each release
        page publishes the SHA-256 of its DMG, so you can confirm the file you downloaded is
        byte-for-byte the one we shipped —{' '}
        <Anchor href="/docs/getting-started#verifying-your-download" size="sm">
          Verifying your download
        </Anchor>{' '}
        has the two commands. Antivirus engines do sometimes flag a notarized Mac app on a
        machine-learning heuristic rather than an actual malware signature. A matching checksum
        can't prove a detection wrong on its own, but together with Apple's notarization scan and a
        clean spctl run it makes a heuristic false positive much the likeliest reading, and we
        report those to the vendor. If the checksum doesn't match, or macOS rejects the file, don't
        open it —{' '}

    ),
  },
  {
    value: 'privacy',
    question: 'Does FinderGit send my data anywhere?',
    answer: (
      <>
        No telemetry, ever. GitHub data (issues, pull requests, stars, fork status) is fetched
        directly from api.github.com using your own credentials. The only exception is the optional{' '}

        stored, and nothing is sent unless you ask.

  },
  {
    value: 'live',
    question: 'How does the live update work?',
    answer:
      'FinderGit uses macOS FSEvents to monitor file system changes in real time. When a file changes inside a watched repository, the status is automatically refreshed within ~300ms.',
