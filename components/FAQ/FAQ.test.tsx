/**
 * The defect lived on the SERVER, so this renders there. Mantine 9 keeps a
 * closed panel in a React <Activity>, which the server renders as nothing: the
 * page Google fetched carried every question and no answer. A jsdom `render`
 * cannot see it -- on the client a hidden Activity still mounts its children.
 * No `env="test"` either, because that switches Mantine's Collapse to a
 * different branch than the one the site runs.
