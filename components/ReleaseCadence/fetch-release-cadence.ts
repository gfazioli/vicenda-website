 * cannot produce a total; it answers 403 to any user agent that looks like a
 * crawler, which is exactly who should see the freshness signal; and reaching
 * it from the client would keep the numbers out of the initial HTML, which on
 * this site has already once read as a failed deploy.
 *
 * Deliberately UNAUTHENTICATED even where GITHUB_TOKEN is set: an
 * authenticated read can see draft releases, and a draft must not be counted.
 * Next's data cache plus the page's `revalidate` keep this to roughly one
 * request an hour, well inside the 60/hr anonymous budget.
 *
 * Never throws. Any failure returns the config-derived fallback, so the strip
 * renders a correct date with no count rather than disappearing.
