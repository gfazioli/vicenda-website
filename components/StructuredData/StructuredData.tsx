  {
    question: 'What is FinderGit?',
    answer:
      'FinderGit is a native macOS application that works as a Git-aware file browser. Think of it as Finder’s list view, but with Git status, branch info, inline diffs, and commit/push/pull actions built in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is FinderGit free?',
    answer:
      'Yes, FinderGit is currently free. If you find it useful, consider sponsoring the project.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is FinderGit on the App Store? How do updates work?',
    answer:
      'FinderGit is distributed directly from findergit.app as a signed and notarized DMG — it’s not on the App Store. Updates are automatic: the app checks for new releases and installs them in place, so you’re always one click away from the latest version.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What macOS version do I need?',
    answer:
      'macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later. FinderGit is built with SwiftUI and uses APIs available from macOS 15+.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which languages does FinderGit speak?',
    answer:
      'English, Italian, French, German, and Spanish. FinderGit follows your Mac’s system language automatically — there is no in-app switcher. To use a different language, reorder your preferred languages in System Settings → General → Language & Region.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does FinderGit replace my Git client?',
    answer:
      'Not entirely — but it covers more ground every release. Day-to-day work happens without leaving the app: status across many repos at once, stage/unstage and discard, commit (with AI-generated messages), push/pull/fetch, branch switching, and keeping forks in sync with their upstream. For advanced surgery (interactive rebase, cherry-pick, complex merges) you’ll still want a full Git client or the terminal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to connect a GitHub account?',
    answer:
      'Only for the GitHub-powered extras — the Account dashboard, the issue / pull-request / star counts in the file browser, and new-star alerts. FinderGit reuses the GitHub CLI if it’s already set up, or a personal access token you paste into Settings — kept in your Keychain, never written to disk. Plain browsing, Git status, diffs and commit / push / pull all work with no GitHub connection at all.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can FinderGit tell me when one of my repos gets a star?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The Account view shows a badge the moment a repository earns a star — naming which repo, not just bumping a number — and you can optionally turn on desktop notifications in Settings → Git. It checks periodically in the background while the app is running.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does FinderGit detect repositories?',
    answer:
      'When you add a root folder, FinderGit recursively scans for directories containing .git/. The scan depth is configurable in Settings (default: 5 levels). Heavy directories like node_modules and DerivedData are automatically skipped.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does FinderGit modify my repositories?',
    answer:
      'Only when you explicitly perform an action (commit, push, pull, stage, etc.). FinderGit reads your repository state via git status and git diff — it never modifies anything without your command.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it safe to open repositories I don’t fully trust?',
    answer:
      'That’s what Repo Trust is for. FinderGit scans each repository’s auto-run surface — hooks and configuration that could execute code when you open, build, or install — without ever running any of it. Repos with findings are flagged in the list, and you get an alert when that surface changes after a pull.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I verify a download — and what if a virus scanner flags it?',
    answer:
      'Every release is signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple, and each release page publishes the SHA-256 of its DMG, so you can confirm the file you downloaded is byte-for-byte the one we shipped. Antivirus engines do sometimes flag a notarized Mac app on a machine-learning heuristic rather than an actual malware signature. A matching checksum can’t prove a detection wrong on its own, but together with Apple’s notarization scan and a clean spctl it makes a heuristic false positive much the likeliest reading, and we report those to the vendor. If the checksum doesn’t match, or macOS rejects the file, don’t open it — tell us.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does FinderGit send my data anywhere?',
    answer:
      'No telemetry, ever. GitHub data (issues, pull requests, stars, fork status) is fetched directly from api.github.com using your own credentials. The only exception is the optional AI commit message feature: when you click ✨ AI, your staged diff is sent to generate the message — nothing is stored, and nothing is sent unless you ask.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the live update work?',
    answer:
      'FinderGit uses macOS FSEvents to monitor file system changes in real time. When a file changes inside a watched repository, the status is automatically refreshed within ~300ms.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I found a bug. How do I report it?',
    answer:
      'Please open a Bug Report on GitHub. Include your FinderGit version, macOS version, and steps to reproduce the issue. Screenshots are very helpful!',
  },
  {
    question: 'I have an idea for a new feature. Where can I suggest it?',
    answer:
      'We’d love to hear your ideas! Open a Feature Request on GitHub and describe what you’d like FinderGit to do. The more detail you provide, the better we can evaluate and prioritize it.',
  },
